 This application uses the data (ToothGrowth) provided by R datasets. It provides the exploratory analysis of the data for different doses and different supplements through 
 a interactive histogram and a bar chart using plotly.

 The data is about the  response of different doses of vitamin C given to the 60 guinea pigs throughtwo different supplements in the growth of length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth). 
 Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery 
methods i.e supplements, orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).
 The data frame has 60 observations and 3 variables.The source of the 
 data frame as given in R help is C. I. Bliss (1952): The Statistics of Bioassay. Academic Press.
